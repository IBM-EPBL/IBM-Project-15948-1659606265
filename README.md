Hazardous Area Monitoring for Industrial Plant powered by IoT
Since technological growth is a continuous process, we must be prepared and aware of any new advances. Because of these technological advancements, daily life has become more convenient. The necessity for automation has become essential. Today, the internet offers access to any data and

Systems and web technology are always evolving. Using a web-based embedded system, a network interface provides remote management and control of embedded devices. Web controllers, also referred to as E-controllers, are used to control Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The most popular technique of web development in the world is called a web controller, also referred to as an Econtroller. A web controller is a collection of embedded devices and software stacks. Large server systems are not always necessary for monitoring, administering,In place of massive server systems for monitoring, managing, and handling data, remote login and monitoring utilising a distributed web control system created using web pages created in web applications are becoming more and more popular. Three features of web control systems that use IoT are energy savings, comfort, and efficiency. Our main goal is to modify the Internet control system for the Internet of Things so that users can access the application from any location in the world via the Internet. You may evaluate dynamic systems and billions of events and warnings with IoT monitoring. By gathering and analysing a variety of IoT data at a web scale from linked devices, consumers, and businesses, IoT monitoring also enables you to bridge the gap between devices and businesses and applications.The industrial monitoring system connects itself with the open-source app Blynk. Blynk connects itself with
esp8266 for virtual control of the devices along with getting updates. The Arduino Mega is the brain of the
project connected to the component and operates them with the code embedded in it. Sensors like smoke
sensors, humidity, and temperature sensors are used to monitor the surroundings of the machine.: energy
savings, comfort, and efficiency. Our main objective is to adapt the Internet control system to the Internet of
Things, allowing users to access the application over the Internet from anywhere in the globe. IoT monitoring
allows you to analyze dynamic systems and analyze billions of events and alerts. IoT monitoring also enables
you to bridge the gap between devices and businesses by collecting and analyzing a wide range of IoT data at a
web scale across connected devices, consumers, and apps.The industrial monitoring system connects itself with the open-source app Blynk. Blynk connects itself with
